# VSCode fasm extension x86-64
## What was done?
- Custom color theme
- Custom syntax highlighting (thanks amatilda for most of work)
- Additional options:
  - highlitghting source code by docs
## What about the future?
- More flexible indexation 
  - Change index only for specific files
  - Make index more effective (rewrite on assembly))
- Highlights function's source file (remember file name for modules/functions)
- Smart refactoring (inside function or between label)
- Smart tips (`mov word [APPROPRIATE_PLACE]`) and input mistakes detection (tricky heuristics)
- Extended syntax for structures (tips about struct's fields) â€” new docs
- Add user's file to index
  
*P. S. Everything was created for internal development needs*
